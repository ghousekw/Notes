How to fix Git always asking for user credentials:

YOU CAN FIX THIS BY CONFIGURING GIT TO STORE YOUR PASSWORD FOR YOU.
Here’s how:

Update the URL of origin remote using SSH instead of HTTPS:
  
  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git

or

Make Git store the username and password and it will never ask for them.

  git config --global credential.helper store

Save the username and password for a session (cache it);
  
  git config --global credential.helper cache

You can also set a timeout for the above setting
  
  git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=600'
