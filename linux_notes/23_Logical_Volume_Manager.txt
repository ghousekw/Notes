Introduction:
-------------
Flexibilty Capacity:
--------------------
. You can create file systems that extend 
  across multiple storage devices.
. You can aggregate multiple storage devices 
  into a single logical volume.

Easily Resize Storage While Online:
-----------------------------------
Expand or shrink file systems in real-time while the data remains online and fully accessible.

Online Data Relocation:
------------------------
Easily migrate data from one storage device to another while online.

Convenient Device Naming:
-------------------------
You can use human-readable device names of your choosing.

/dev/vg_database/lv_db_logs vs/dev/sdb3

Disk Stripping:
---------------
Increase throughout by allowing your system to read data in parallel.

Data Redundancy/Data Mirroring:
-------------------------------
Increase fault tolerance and readability by having more than one copy of your data.

Snapshots:
-----------
create point-in-time Snapshots of your filesystems.

LVM: Layers of Abstraction:
---------------------------
Physical Volumes(PV) are first level of Abstraction. Ex.Physical hard drives

Volume Group(VG)  are second level of Abstraction. It is made up of one or more Physical volumes.You can have different types of PVs.

logical Volumes(LV): are created from volumes groups(VG).File systems are then created on top of the logical volumes.Without lvm you create file systems on disk partitions.with lvm you create file systems on logical volumes.As long as their is free space on volume groups, logical volumes can be extended.You can also shrink logical volumes to reclaim unused space, but typically impractice you'll find yourself extending logical volumes.

Logical Volume Creation Process:
--------------------------------
. Create one or more physical volumes.
. Create a volume group from those one or more physical volumes.
. create one or more logical volumes from the volume group.

For this you will need root privilages.
ex:
lvmdiskscan
  -list all available physical volumes.
lsblk
lsblk -p 
  -display with full address
df -h
fdisk -l
  -to see the storage that is attached to your linux system

pvcreate /dev/sdb
  - Initialize a disk for use by the logical manager
pvs
  - to list physical volumes

vgcreate vg_app /dev/sdb
  - to create a volume group
vgs
  - to list volume group

pvs
  - to check which physical volumes belongs to which volume group

lvcreate -L 20G -n lv_data vg_app
  - to create a logical volume with name lv_data and name of volume group which we will be used.
lvs
  - to list logical volumes
lvdisplay
  - to display with full details

mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vg_app
  - to create a file system on logical volume
mkdir /data
  - creating a mount point
mount /dev/vg_app/lv_data /data
  - mounting the file system on this logical volumes.
df -h /data
  - to display file system
lvcreate -L 5G -n lv_app vg_app 
  -creating a logical volume with 5G on Volume group
lvs 
  - displays the logical Volumes
mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vg_app/lv_app
mkdir /app

vi /etc/fstab
/dev/vg_app/lv_app /app ext4 defaults 0 0

mount /app
df -h /app
  - to check whether it is mounted or not
ls -l /dev/vg_app/lv_app
ls -l /dev/mapper/vg_app-lv_app
ls -l /dev/dm-1
lvdisk 
vgs
lvcreate -L 25G -n lv_logs vg_app
lvdisplay
lvdisplay -m
pvdisplay -m
vgdisplay -m
lvcreate -l 100%FREE      // lvcreate -l 6399
lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n lv_logs vg_app
lvs
vgs
lvmdiskscan
  - to scan the available logical volume
pvcreate /dev/sdc

extended volume groups and logical volumes:
-------------------------------------------
vgextend vg_app /dev/sdc
vgs
pvs
df -h /data
  - to show the current the file system size
lvextend -L +5G -r /dev/vg_app/lv_data
lvs
df -h /data
lvextend -L +5G /dev/vg_app/lv_data
  - If we didn't mention "-r" then it will not be able to display in file systems.
  -Then we again have to resize file system to display in filesystems
resize2fs /dev/vg_app/lv_data
df -h /data
lvdisplay -m /dev/vg_app/lv_data

Mirroring logical volumes:
--------------------------
lvmdiskscan
pvcreate /dev/sdd /dev/sde
pvs
vgcreate vg_safe /dev/sdd /dev/sde
vgs
lvcreate -m 1 -L 5G -n lv_secrets vg_safe
lvs
lvs -a
pvdisplay -m
mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vg_safe/lv_secrets
mkdir /secrets
mount /dev/vg_safe/lv_secrets /secrets
df -h /secrets

How to delete lvm,vg,pv:
------------------------
umount /secrets
lvremove /dev/vg_safe/lv_secrets
vgs
vgreduce vg_safe /dev/sde
vgs
pvremove /dev/sde
vgremove vg_safe
vgs
pvs
pvremove /dev/sdd

Migrate from one storage to another:
------------------------------------
pvcreate /dev/sde
vgextend vg_app /dev/sde
pvs
pvmove /dev/sdb /dev/sde
pvs
pvdisplay /dev/sdb
vgreduce vg_app /dev/sdb
pvremove /dev/sdb
pvs
