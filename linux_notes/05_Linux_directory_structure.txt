Linux Directory Structure
Location Of Operating System components
Application diretory structures

Common Directories:
-------------------

. /  "Root" the top of the file system hierarchy.
. /bin Binaries and other executable programs 
    -They are called binaries because it contains source code in 0s and 1s which is machine readable format.
. /etc System Configuration files
. /home Home Directories
. /opt Optional third party software
. /tmp Temporary space, typically cleared on reboot.
    - it will automatically clear the memory while reboot
. /usr User related programs, lib and Docs.
. /usr/bin Binaries and other executable programs
. /usr/lib libraries
. /usr/local Locally installed software that is not part of the base operating system.
. /usr/sbin System admininstration binaries
. /var Variable data, most notably log files
. /var/log Log files
. /cdrom Mount Point for CD-ROMs
. /dev Device files, typically controlled by the operating system and the system admininstrators
. /cgroup Control Groups hierarchy
. /export shared file systems
. /lib System libraries
. /lib64 System libraries 64bit
. /lost+found Used by the file system to store recovered files after a file system check has been performed
. /media Used to mount removable media like CD-ROMs
. /mnt Used to mount external file systems
. /proc Provides info about running processes
. /sbin System admininstration binaries
. /selinux Used to display information about SELinux.
. /srv Contains data which is served by the system
. /srv/www Web Server files.
. /srv/ftp FTP files
. /sys Used to display and sometimes configure the devices known to the Linux Kernel

Application Directory structures:
---------------------------------
Here crashplan is a backup software.
. /usr/local/crashplan/bin
. /usr/local/crashplan/etc
. /usr/local/crashplan/lib
. /usr/local/crashplan/log

Here avg is an antivirus software
. /opt/avg/bin 
. /opt/avg/etc 
. /opt/avg/lib 
. /opt/avg/log

Every application follows different patterns on storing their file Directory Structure
. /etc/opt/myapp
. /opt/myapp/bin
. /opt/myapp/lib
. /var/opt/myapp

Sometimes application can also be stored on shared manners.
. /usr/local/bin/myapp
. /usr/local/etc/myapp.conf
. /usr.local/lib/linmyapp.so

Sometimes the companies or orgranization user their names for directory structuring

Here acme is a company name
. /opt/acme
. /opt/acme/bin
. /opt/acme/etc

To similar above they also use their company/product name

. /opt/google
. /opt/google/chrome
. /opt/google/earth

Some Other examples are

. /opt/web-team
. /opt/acme/web-team
. /usr/local/acme/web-team
