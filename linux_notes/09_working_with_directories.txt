How to use directory shortcuts
How to execute commands outside of $PATH
How to create and remove directories

Directories:
Are containers for other files and directories.
provide a tree like structure
Can be accessed by name or shortcut

Directory Shortcuts:
--------------------
.    - This directory
..   - Parent directory
cd - - Change to previous directory
  ex: cd dir_name
      cd ..
      cd /home/adminuser
      cd /var/tmp
      
 *echo $OLDPWD - This will show previous directory where we were before.

Directory Seperator:
/    - Directory Seperator(/ forward slash)

Executing Commands:
-------------------
$PATH determines command search path.
You can specify a command with a full path
you can execute command not in $PATH
./command = Execute command in this dir.

examples:
echo $PATH

which cat - Tells the path
op: /bin/cat

cat sales.data - Execute the file

/bin/cat sales.data -Another way to open and execute

/home/adminuser/my-cat/cat
cd my-cat

./cat
explanation: 
./ - If we want to execute something and we are in the same directory then we use "./filename"

Creating and Removing Directories:
----------------------------------
mkdir [-p] directory - create a directory
'p' stands for parent directory
ex: mkdir -p /dir1/dir2/dir3
explanation: It will only create directory when we use "-p" if we want to create multiple directories with parent directories.

rmdir [-p] directory -remove a directory - It will only remove empty directory

rm -rf directory - recursively removes directory
