Listing All files, Including Hidden Files
------------------------------------------
. Hidden files begin with a period
   .sometimes called 'dot files'
. Hidden files are not displayed by default
. To show hidden files with ls, use ls -a.
. Command options can be combined.
  .ls -l -a is the same as -la and ls -al

Listing Files by Type:
----------------------
Use 'ls -F' to reveal file types.
/   - directory
@   - link
*   - executable

Symbolic Links:
---------------
. A link is a points to the actual file or directory
. Use the link as if it were the file.
. A link can be used to create a shortcut
    . Use for long file or directory name
    . Use to indicate the current version of software
ex: 
ls -lF
ls -F

List files by time and in reverse:
----------------------------------
ls -t    List files by time
ls -r    reverse order
ls -latr long listing Including all files reverse sorted by time

List files recursively
ls -R

The tree command:
similar to ls -R but creates visual Output
tree -d List directories only
tree -c colorize Output

List directories,not contents:
ls -d List directory name not contents

Listing files with color
ls -color colorize the output

Working with spaces in Names:
Just say no to spaces!
Alternatives:
Hyphens(-)
Underscores(_)
CamelCase

Encapsulate the entire file name in quotes
Use a backslash(\) to escape spaces
